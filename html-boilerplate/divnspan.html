        <p>VSCode has a built-in shortcut you can use for generating all the boilerplate in one go. <a href="http://google.com">Please</a> note that this shortcut only works while editing a file with the ‘.html’ extension or a text file with the HTML language already selected. <a href="http://rmf24.pl">To trigger the</a> shortcut, delete everything in the index.html file and just enter ! on the first line. This will bring up a couple of options. Press the enter key to choose the first one, and voila, you should have all the boilerplate populated for you.</p>

            But it’s still good to know how to write the boilerplate yourself in case you find yourself using a text editor like notepad (heaven forbid) which doesn’t have this shortcut. <span>Try</span> not to use the shortcut in your first few HTML projects, so you can build some muscle memory for writing the boilerplate code.
